## Gameplay

Get ready for an exciting adventure with these instructions:

1. **Enter Your Hero's Name**: As you start the game, you'll be prompted to enter your character's name. Type it in and press Enter to personalize your adventure.

2. **Explore the Mystical Forest**: You will begin your journey in a mysterious forest, filled with elemental wonders. There are four elemental areas to explore, each representing a different power:
   - North: The power of Ice
   - South: The intensity of Fire
   - East: The flowing energy of Water
   - West: The solid foundation of Earth

3. **Engage in Battle with Creatures**: In each elemental area, you'll come across three formidable creatures. To aid you in your quest, you'll receive a random number of sword moves.

4. **Strategize Your Moves**: Creatures possess various ranks, making each battle unique. You'll need to choose wisely between 'attack' and 'defend' to overcome your foes. Here's how to approach each move:
   - **Attack**: Use this option to attempt to defeat a creature. Success depends on the creature's rank.
   - **Defend**: Choose 'defend' to shield yourself from a creature's attack.

5. **Victory or Defeat**: Your ultimate goal is to conquer all three creatures in the area. However, be cautious! If you run out of sword moves, the game will come to an end. But if you manage to defeat all the creatures, you'll emerge as the victorious hero of the mystical forest!
